# World_Weather_Analysis

For the Module 6 challenge assignment, weather description data was used to enhance an app called PlanMyTrip. 

Users are able to input statements to filter data for their weather preferences, which will in turn be used to see potential travel destinations with nearby hotels. In the testing, four different cities were chosen from a list of potential travel destinations. The temperature of these destinatations was between 70 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. A travel itinerary with a travel route between the four cities was created using the Geoapify Routing API.
